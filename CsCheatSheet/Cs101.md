## Primitive Types

Integers

| bit | signed   | unsigned |
| --- | -------- | -------- |
|  8  | `sbyte`  | `byte`   |
| 16  | `short`  | `ushort` |
| 32  | `int`    | `uint`   |
| 64  | `long`   | `ulong`  |

IE754 floating-point binary:

| bit |          | exponent | mantissa |
| --- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
|  32 | `float`  |       8  |       23 |
|  64 | `double` |      11  |       52 |

non-standard:

`decimal` is alo a floating-point binary.
<br/>It does not fall under the IE754 standard of using exponents of 2.
<br/>It instead uses a proper exponents of 10 similar to us.
<br/>Much slower to process, less compatible with `Math` functions. And have less precision range in comparison to `double` despite occupying 128 bits. But it is capable of accurately represent numbers `double` is incapable of due to its base 10 system.

Others:

`bool`, `string`, `char`

# Constant

`const` are Constant. Obviously.

`readonly` are basically `const` when used alongside `static`. But it can also be `private`.

C# only allows ***primitive types*** to be `const`, since `const` needs to be ***compile-time*** constant. So `class` and custom `struct` wants `static readonly` instead of `const`.

A `readonly class` / `struct` are only ***read-only*** in a sense you cannot re-assign the `variable` itself. There is ***nothing stopping*** their properties, or in case of Containers/Collection their elements to be ***modified***.

## `string` in C#

```cs
string name = Gio;
double price = 25.625888;
double shop = PoyoyoShop;
string a = "{name} is for sale at {} \njust for {price:C2} ({price})."
string b = $"{name} is for sale \njust for {price:C2} ({price}).";
string c = @"{name} is for sale \njust for {price:C2} ({price}).";
string d = $@"{name} is for sale \njust for {price:C2} ({price}).";

/* Output:
a:
{name} is for sale
just for {price:C2} ({price})
b:
Gio is for sale
just for $25.62 (25.625888)
c:
{name} is for sale \njust for {price:C2} ({price})
d:
Gio is for sale \njust for $25.62 (25.625888)
*/
```

Numeric Formatting:

- `C`: Currency. Adapts to machine local for the symbol.
- `N`: Have Thousand Separator.
- `G`: Scientific notation.
- `P`: Percentage

## Containers

| C++                                | C#                               |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `std::vector<T>`                   | `List<T>`                        |
| `std::unordered_map<TKey, TValue>` | `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`       |
| `std::map<TKey, TValue>`           | `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>` |
| `std::unordered_set<T>`            | `HashSet<T>`                     |
| `std::set<T>`                      | `SortedSet<T>`                   |
| `std::stack<T>`                    | `Stack<T>`                       |
| `std::queue<T>`                    | `Queue<T>`                       |

## `object`

Everything is an `object`, all primitive types are `object` and all of your custom `class` and `struct` are all `object`s. You can consider it the most generic type, but there is also no safety, so you need to be careful when using it.

Discord Command Parameters are returned as:

```cs
Dictionary<string, object>
```

## Common Interfaces

Container Interfaces goes:

- `IEnumerable<T>`: Basically any containers or anything that can be iterated over.
- `ICollection<T>`: `IEnumerable` but knows it's size / length / count.
- `IList<T>` & `IDictionary`: `ICollection<T>` but can access element by index `[]`.

Others:

- `IConvertible`: Can call `Convert.ToXX`, typically useful for converting between number types.
- `IEquatable<T>`: Runs a faster `.Equals()`.

## Function Delegate & Lamda

Functions can be delegated by:

```cs
Func<TInput1, TInput2, ... TInputX, TOut> // Takes TInput(s) retuns TOut
Action<TInput1, TInput2, ... TInputX> // Basically Func<> but returns `void`
// .NET only supports up to 16 Inputs
```

Functions can also be written in lamba:

```cs
a => a + 2;
// would be equal to
// ..variable name need not match
int addByTwo(int x)
{
    return x + 2;
}

// for multi input, they need to be in a bracket
(x, y) => x << y;
int BitShiftLeft(int x, int y)
{
    return x << y;
}

// for no input:
() => "Hello World";
string HelloWorld()
{
    return "Hello World";
}

// Can also define multi line:
() => {
    // do something
    return something;
};
```

Lambda can also be used to shorten writing single-line functions:

```cs
addByTwo(int x) => x + 2;
```

## Pass by Reference

```cs
// Basic pass by Reference
function<T>(ref T value)

// Pass by Reference as Read-Only
// ..similar to `(const T& value)` in C++
function<T>(in T value)

function<T>(out T value)
// Practically the same with
T value = function();
// But now you can return multiple values
```

`class` are ***pass by reference*** by ***default***, so these are typically only useful for primitive types or `struct`s.
